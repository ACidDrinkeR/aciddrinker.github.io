# My First website: http://computableverse.com

I'm going to use this site as a personal blog ranging from pretty much anything I'm comfortable sharing online. 
But I'm also hoping to learn atleast the basics of web development by creating and managing/updating this site.  

Some of which include the following:
* Jekyll
* DNS+Web-hosting
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* Twitter Bootstrap framework
* Python (maybe)
