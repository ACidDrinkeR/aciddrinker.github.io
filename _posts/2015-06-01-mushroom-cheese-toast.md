So I made an awesome mushroom cheese toast the other day and here is how to make it. Beware though, thereâ€™s tons of cheeeese and butter in here; not for you diet people!

Take a non-stick pan and throw in a decently sized chunk of butter on lowest flame for about a minute. Now, add mushrooms!

Cover the pan and let the mushrooms cook for about 5 minutes on lowest flame. Now time to add some cheeeese!

Add some more butter and cover the pan again for 5 minutes. Add a little grated garlic, salt, and pepper. Now toast the bread (in the pan or grill or oven)!

Now pour the delicious mushroom-cheese goodies on the toast and voila!
