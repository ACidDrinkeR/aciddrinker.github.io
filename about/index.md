# Welcome to [my](http://mitesh.ninja) blog.
I enjoy writing stuff, so I decided to [start blogging](/blog/why-blog/).  
The blog will include posts about personal and technical stuff; mainly revolving around my life, computers and the multi-verse.  

I want to keep the site **minimal**, **clean** and **void of distractions**. i.e to the point. Hence it has a very simple color scheme: [ 'Black', 'Gray', 'White', 'Aqua Green' ] and no unnecessary stuff like 'Tags' and 'Share' etc.

This site was coded using HTML, CSS, Jekyll and Twitter Bootstrap. I have hard coded most of the code from scratch. 
If you wish to use my-site design, you are free to do so (it's licensed under MIT License), you can fork the whole code from
my [GitHub Page](https://github.com/miteshms). I also use Google Analytics to track website traffic. 

This site/blog was launched on **2nd April**, 2015.
